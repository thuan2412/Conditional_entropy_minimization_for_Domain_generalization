Conditional entropy invariant risk minimization for AC-CMNIST

Run: please run "val_main.py" for the results. If you want to change the parameters, please find at "config.py". There are some interesting parameters, for example, --test_valid to control the tuning procedure, --val to control the ratio of validation set, 

To reproduce the results from IRM, ERM, IB-IRM and IB-ERM, you need to change the name of algorithm or, just use the original code from https://github.com/ahujak/IB-IRM 

The checkpoints are not stored, and the final results will be printed after the whole run. 

Our code is based on the [this repo](https://github.com/ahujak/IB-IRM) at https://github.com/ahujak/IB-IRM
